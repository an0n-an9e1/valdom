# valdom

url existance checker!

This program is for checking url existance(it checks if a url exists or is it just a random one), its meant to run as you would run a regular python file!
Or you can create a launcher by specifying the directory in which you have installed valdom, and the comand shoul look like `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`!
